    "text": "Introduction\nMunicipal government meetings are a place where policy is discussed by elected officials, a place for the community to provide last minute comment on policy, and the place where policy is ultimately enacted. The rapid growth and adoption of remotely available, and audio or video recorded, municipal government meetings enables the study of urban politics possible on new scales.\n\nScale is hard\nUnderstanding what is available for each municipality\nChoosing what to store and how\nThe data itself\n\nThis paper introduces a new dataset called: “Councils in Action” which can be used to study municipal government political deliberations and the enactment of public policy. Using Councils in Action, we have created tools for exploratory data analysis to support new forms of urban political scholarship.\n\nTooling shouldn’t just be limited to academics\nSuch data can be used to create search engines for journalists and members of the community\nQuerying, filtering, and more statistical methods are all available to remove barriers to exploring the dataset.\n\nExploratory data analysis is the process of using summary statistics and data visualization to allow an individual to get a better understanding of the data and potentially help form hypotheses (Tukey, 1980).\n\nTukey, J. W. (1980). Exploratory data analysis. ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Advances in Geographic Information Systems.\n\nAs municipal government meetings become more fully digitized and available, we argue that exploratory data analysis can be used to remove barriers that are created with scale.\nEDA is especially useful at scale when evaluating hypotheses that may be computationally complex prior to working on the problem in earnest.\n\nOur recent work with Council Data Project produced data attempts to solve two problems of urban politics scholarship: municipal government data used in urban political scholarship is typically limited to a single or few municipalities, and such data is typically not machine-readable for use in large-scale quantitative study.\n\nCouncils in Action is a dataset composed of high-quality transcripts, video, audio, voting data, and policy documents.\nThe tools we have created allow for large-scale, comparative analysis of municipal meetings.\nUnlike prior datasets which enable urban political scholarship, Councils in Action has both transcripts and policy outcomes together.\n\nThis paper uses exploratory data analysis to explore how meeting transcripts and other text-as-data can be combined with traditional municipal government meeting data (i.e. voting records and policy documents) to enable comparative, longitudinal, urban political scholarship.\n\nWe discuss the broader use of text-as-data in the larger field of political science\nWe demonstrate a few methods which we argue are a start for enabling longitudinal-comparative urban political research.\n\nTODO: Reference limitations? (I.e. “recordings are common in typically large, wealthy municipalities”, our dataset naturally tends towards the larger municipalities)"

(Einstein et al., 2018, 2022; Sahn, 2022; Yoder, 2020)\nSpecifically these studies heavily rely on states and cities which release public comments with their meeting minutes.\nFurther, quantitative urban political science scholarship tends to tie the available public comments to policy documents or decisions that were discussed during the same meeting.\nQuantitative urban political scholarship as diverse as the larger field of political science is possible when provided access to a large corpus of transcript data.
